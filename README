This gadget pulls forecasting data for air quality from the AIRNow API and displays it in a GMail gadget. The gadget provides a form so new zipcodes can be queried and persisted.

Note that this currently immplementation only works in GMail (as opposed to iGoogle or Apps Sites). Fixing this would be a great place for you to start if you wanted to help. :)
